## Whisky Store Inventory Management Tool

The owners of a Whisky Store want a web app which will help them keep on top of the store inventory. This is not an app that customers will see, but will be used to check stock levels and see what needs to be ordered soon.

You should be able to add stock, which would have a distillery and brand as well as the quantity available.

### MVP:

- Create distilleries with the quantity of whisky bottles that are in stock
- Create whisky bottles
- Show an inventory page listing distilleries and whisky bottles
- Show a stock level for the inventory items e.g. High/Medium/Low

### Possible Extensions:

- Add a buy and sell price to each stock item
- Calculate the possible markup on items and show on inventory page
- Any other ideas you might come up with
